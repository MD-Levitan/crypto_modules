## Crypto Modules

This repository contains crypto modules with Belarusian standards for kernel.
It also contains some GOST crypto algorithms, that were used in Belarus before 
creating STB standarts. 

## Algorithms
+ BELT
+ KCBC
+ MAGMA
+ KUZNYECHIK
+ CFB

# BELT
- [STB Standart](http://apmi.bsu.by/assets/files/std/belt-spec27.pdf)
- ASNI: "belt-ecbNNN"

# KCBC
- [STB Standart](http://apmi.bsu.by/assets/files/std/belt-spec27.pdf)
- Description: It's a mode of encryption, which is work like XCBC-mode. 
- KCBC(BELT) == BMAC
